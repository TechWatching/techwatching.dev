You have a dependency in your project and want to execute a command using it? The [pnpm exec](https://pnpm.io/cli/exec) command can help you with that.

## An example

```bash
 pnpm exec eslint . --ext .ts
```

Given that ESLint is a project dependency, this example shows how to use the `pnpm exec` command to run the ESLint tool on all TypeScript files within the project.

## Some use cases

* You need to do a specific command that is not part of your npm scripts
    
* You want to execute a tool that is a dependency of your project without having to install it globally
    
* You need to execute a CLI package command in a CI pipeline, and this package is already included in the `devDependencies` of your project.
    

## Good to know

If the command you are using does not conflict with a built-in pnpm command, there is no need to specify 'exec'. Referring to the previous example, you can simply run:

```bash
 pnpm eslint . --ext .ts
```

It's one of the small details that make using `pnpm` so pleasant.
