In this article, I will walk you through the process of integrating an ASP.NET Core API with a Nuxt.js front end to have a stack that provides a nice developer experience to build web applications.

To make things easier to reproduce, we will create everything from scratch. I will do everything on the command line so that regardless of the IDE you are using (Rider, vscode, Visual Studio, etc) you will be able to understand what‚Äôs going on and follow along.

Let‚Äôs start by initializing a git repository in a new folder with a `gitignore` file for .NET:

```bash
mkdir AspnetWithNuxt
git init
dotnet new gitignore
```

We can create an empty .NET solution using the new `slnx` format to have a much cleaner and simple solution file:

```bash
dotnet new sln -n AspnetWithNuxt--format slnx
```

Then we can use the ASPNET Core Web API template to create the API:

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o WebApi
dotnet sln AspnetWithNuxt.slnx add WebApi\WebApi.csproj
```

The generated ASP.NET Core API only contains one route `weatherforecast` that returns a list of random weather forecasts like these:

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-02-24",
    "temperatureC": 40,
    "summary": "Cool",
    "temperatureF": 103
  },
  {
    "date": "2025-02-25",
    "temperatureC": 14,
    "summary": "Balmy",
    "temperatureF": 57
  }
]
```

We can now initialize the Nuxt project using the template ‚ÄúNuxt 3 with v4 compat‚Äù. I will be using `pnpm` as my package manager, because [it‚Äôs performant and nice to use](https://pnpm.io/) (check this [blog article series](https://bordeauxcoders.com/series/pnpm-101) here if you want to learn more about pnpm).

```powershell
pnpx nuxi init WebApp -t v4-compat --packageManager pnpm --gitInit false
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">I could have used the default template or another <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/nuxt/starter?tab=readme-ov-file#templates" style="pointer-events: none">starter template</a> but this one will make my app compatible with Nuxt 4 when it is released.</div>
</div>

The generated project just contains an `App.vue` that uses the built-in `NuxtWelcome` component. Let‚Äôs replace it with a new component `WeatherForecasts` that will make a call to the API and render the weather forecasts:

```vue
<template>
  <WeatherForecasts/>
</template>
```

To initialize the `WeatherForecasts` component, we can use the `nuxi` CLI (using `nuxt` would also work by the way now that the project is initialized).

```bash
pnpm nuxi add component WeatherForecasts
```

The content of the component will be quite simple, the idea is to display data retrieved from the API.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
interface WeatherForecast {
  date: string;
  temperatureC: number;
  temperatureF: number;
  summary: string;
}
const { data: weatherForecasts } = await useFetch<WeatherForecast[]>('/api/weatherforecast');
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-if="weatherForecasts">
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Date</th>
            <th>Summary</th>
            <th>T (¬∞C)</th>
            <th>T (¬∞F)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr v-for="item in weatherForecasts" :key="item.date">
            <td>{{ item.date }}</td>
            <td>{{ item.summary }}</td>
            <td>{{ item.temperatureC }}</td>
            <td>{{ item.temperatureF }}</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

In the code, you can notice that the request is made to `/api/weatherforecast` and not to the URL of the `WebApi`. Indeed, we want to proxy the requests targeting `/api/**` to the back end for several reasons:

* Eliminate the need to configure specific CORS rules in the `WebApi`to prevent CORS errors due to different origins between the `WebApp` and the `WebApi`

* Avoid specifying the complete URL of the `WebApi` each time we make a request in a component

* Adopt a similar mechanism to the one that will be used when the application is deployed in the cloud (we will probably also proxy the traffic to the API but it will be directly configured in the infrastructure)


As it is very well explained in this [video](https://youtu.be/J4E5uYz5AY8?si=cx0YkLdpiGWO1hYA) from Alexander Lichter, there are multiple strategies to do that, but using [Vite proxy](https://vite.dev/config/server-options#server-proxy) or [Nuxt/Nitro devProxy](https://nitro.build/config#devproxy) will only work on the client side and not when using Server Side Rendering. As Nuxt is a Vue framework that supports SSR by default, it would be a shame not to have the proxy work with SSR. So the solution is to configure the route rules in the Nuxt configuration file:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  compatibilityDate: '2024-11-01',
  devtools: { enabled: true },
  future: {
    compatibilityVersion: 4
  },
  $development: {
    routeRules: {
      '/api/**': {
        proxy: 'http://localhost:5096/**',
      }
    },
  },
})
```

By placing this configuration in `$development`, I ensure it only applies to the development environment (locally, in my case). This is because I will likely handle request routing in my infrastructure configuration when my application is deployed in the cloud.

To finish, we can launch the front end and the back end:

```bash
// Launch the Nuxt application front end
pnpm --dir WebApp dev
```

```bash
// Launch the ASP.NET Core API
dotnet run --project WebApi\WebApi.csproj
```

Here are the weather forecasts retrieved from the API and displayed in the Front:

Nothing fancy, but I hope this gives you a good understanding of how we can integrate an ASP.NET Core API with a Nuxt front end. Not everything is perfect, we have the URL of the API hardcoded in the Nuxt configuration, and we have to launch the API and the front end separately. In an upcoming article, we will explore how to use .NET Aspire to improve the developer experience.
