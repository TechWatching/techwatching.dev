In our daily job, we often have to query secure REST APIs that require our HTTP requests to have a valid access token in their Authorization header. 
Of course, many APIs come with an SDK that makes the job easier for us as it directly takes care of retrieving a token and sending the authenticated HTTP requests.
However, it is not always the case and knowing how to implement that using HttpClient, IMemoryCache, and DelegatingHandler can become pretty useful.

## Context

Let's imagine we have a very simple API that contains the following routes :

![Open API specifications of the Users API](/posts/images/delegatinghandler_api_1.png){.rounded-lg .mx-auto }

The `POST /login` route returns an `AuthResponse` that contains the necessary Bearer token to call the 2 protected routes `GET /users` and `PUT /users/{username}`.

We want to implement an IUserService that has 2 methods: 
- `GetAllUsers` to retrieve the list of users that will use the `GET /users` route
- `UpdateUser` to update a user that will use the `PUT /users/{username}` route

```csharp
public interface IUserService
{
    Task<IReadOnlyCollection<User>> GetAllUsers();
    Task UpdateUser(User userToUpdate);
}
```

Each of these methods needs to retrieve a valid token from the `POST /login` route and set the Authorization header with this token in the HTTP request to each of the protected routes.

The following code shows how to retrieve the token:

```csharp
var body = new { login = "login", password = "password" };
var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync("login", new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body)));
var authResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<AuthResponse>();
```

where `AuthResponse` is a class we defined to map the response of the `POST /login` route

```csharp
public class AuthResponse
{
  public string Token { get; set; }
  public DateTime Expiration { get; set; }
}
```

So now we have the code to retrieve the token, how do we use it to implement our `IUserService`?

## Retrieve the token from a private method 
The easiest way to do that is to create a private method in `UserService` that returns this token and to call it from `GetAllUsers` and `UpdateUser`. That would give us something like that :

```csharp
public class UserService : IUserService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    public UserService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<IReadOnlyCollection<User>> GetAllUsers()
    {
        var token = await RetrieveToken();
        var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "user");
        request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
        var response = await _httpClient.SendAsync(request);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<IReadOnlyCollection<User>>();
    }

    public async Task UpdateUser(User userToUpdate)
    {
        var token = await RetrieveToken();
        var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Put, $"user/{userToUpdate.Name}");
        request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
        request.Content = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(userToUpdate));
        var response = await _httpClient.SendAsync(request);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    }

    private async Task<string> RetrieveToken()
    {
        var body = new { login = "login", password = "password" };
        var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync("login", new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body)));
        var authResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<AuthResponse>();
        return authResponse.Token;
    }
}
```

There are two main problems with this way of doing things: 
- We have some code duplication as we are calling the `RetrieveToken` in each of our methods calling the API. That could be okay here as we only have 2 methods calling the API but that can quickly be problematic if we start to have more methods and repeat the call to `RetrieveToken`in each method.
- For each call to an authenticated route of the API, we are making a call to the `login` route even if our token from a previous call is probably still valid. 

## Use a dedicated service to retrieve the token and save it for future calls
Although it's not necessary at this point, it can be interesting to move the code of our private method `RetrieveToken` into a separate service `UserApiAuthenticationService` that will be injected in `UserService`. That way, if the authentication method changes someday, `UserService` implementation won't change. Moreover, we won't mess with the same `HttpClient` for authentication and other calls. 

```csharp
public class UserApiAuthenticationService : IUserApiAuthenticationService
{
    private readonly IMemoryCache _memoryCache;
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public UserApiAuthenticationService(HttpClient httpClient, IMemoryCache memoryCache)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
        _memoryCache = memoryCache;
    }

    public async Task<string> RetrieveToken()
    {
        DateTime expirationDate;
        if (!_memoryCache.TryGetValue("Token", out string token))
        {
            var body = new { login = "login", password = "password" };
            var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync("login", new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body)));
            (token,  expirationDate) = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<AuthResponse>();
            _memoryCache.Set("Token", token, new DateTimeOffset(expirationDate));
        }
        return token;
    }
}
```

To avoid requesting always the same token to the API, we added a line to store the token in the memory cache and a line to check if the token is already in the cache before querying the API.
We could also have used a class as a singleton to store the token and its expiration date, but the built-in `IMemoryCache` of ASP.NET Core is more convenient and handle the expiration of the token for us by removing it from the cache when the date is passed. You can find more about cache memory in ASP.NET Core [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/memory?view=aspnetcore-3.1&wt.mc_id=MVP_430820).

## Use a Delegating handler to directly set the token in the HttpClient request

Handling the token retrieval in a separate service is nice but that does not solve the issue of duplicated code. Even if the `RetrieveToken` method is now part of `UserApiAuthenticationService`, each method of `UserService` will still call `RetrieveToken`. Moreover setting the token on each request should not be a concern of `UserService`.

That's where come *delegating handlers*. A delegating handler is quite similar to an ASP.NET Core middleware but instead of applying some processing on an incoming request and its response, it does so on an outgoing request and its response. In concrete terms, you use a delegating handler to apply something (logging, authentication, caching ...) to HTTP requests you make to an API using an `HttpClient`. To learn more about *delegating handlers* there is a nice [article](https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/httpclientfactory-aspnetcore-outgoing-request-middleware-pipeline-delegatinghandlers) from Steve Gordon on the topic. 

A custom delegating handler is exactly what we need: a piece of code that all our HTTP requests from `UserService` will go through and where we will be able to set the token on the authentication header of each request. Here is the code of our custom delegating handler:

```csharp
public class UserApiAuthenticationHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    private readonly IUserApiAuthenticationService _authenticationService;

    public UserApiAuthenticationHandler(IUserApiAuthenticationService authenticationService)
    {
        _authenticationService = authenticationService;
    }
    
    protected async override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationTokencancellationToken)
    {
        var token = await _authenticationService.RetrieveToken();
        request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
        return await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

That's it, we don't need anymore to handle token retrieval on UserService which becomes simpler: 

```csharp
public class UserService : 
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    public UserService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<IReadOnlyCollection<User>> GetAllUsers()
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(new Uri("user"));
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<IReadOnlyCollection<User>>();
    }

    public async Task UpdateUser(User userToUpdate)
    {
        var content = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(userToUpdate));
        var response = await _httpClient.PutAsync($"user/{userToUpdate.Name}", content);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    }
}
```

To finish we just have to specify in the `Startup.cs` on which HttpClient to apply the delegating handler we have just created.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollectionservices)
{
    services.AddMemoryCache();
    services.AddHttpClient<IUserApiAuthenticationService, UserApiAuthenticationService>()
            .ConfigureHttpClient(c => c.BaseAddress ="http://urltotheuserapi.com");
    
    services.AddTransient<UserApiAuthenticationHandler>();
    services.AddHttpClient<UserService, UserService>()
            .ConfigureHttpClient(c => c.BaseAddress ="http://urltotheuserapi.com")
            .AddHttpMessageHandler<UserApiAuthenticationHanler>();
}
``` 

## To conclude

To summarize, we have put the code that retrieves a token in a separate dedicated service that caches the token until it expires. And we have created a custom delegating handler that calls this service and sets the retrieved token on the authentication header of each HTTP request to the API.
