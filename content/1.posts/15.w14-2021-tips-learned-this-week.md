This week I learned a few things related to vscode and especially about the `Azure IoT Hub` vscode extension.

## Accessing Azure resources in vscode from a specific tenant.

There are a lot of vscode extensions (like the ones in [this extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack)) that allow you to access and manipulate your Azure resources from Visual Studio Code. 

This [specific extension `Azure Account`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) makes it easy for you to sign in to your Azure account and select the subscription you want to use. But what if you are working in a consulting company that works for different companies? How do you indicate the tenant of the customer to sign in to? Well, the answer is quite simple, the extension exposes a setting in vscode to specify a specific tenant to use.

If you like to update the settings in JSON mode the key to use is `azure.tenant`

## Azure IoT Hub vs code extension is awesome.

I think everything is in the title. I knew about this extension before this week but I did not take the time to really use it. However this week it helped me a lot for my sprint demo where I needed to show new functionalities I implemented on an IoT backend: modify device twin tags in the IoT Hub and send some messages to an IoT device under certain conditions.

The Azure IoT Hub extension adds an `Azure IoT Hub` view in the Explorer where you can see the devices of the IoT Hub you selected and can do some actions on them.

There are also a lot of commands you can use to interact with an IoT Hub and its devices.

You can do pretty much anything you want from sending C2D / D2C messages to monitoring C2D / D2C messages. I found it quite nice to be able to directly visualize and edit a device twin as a JSON  document in vs code.

To quickly test something related to IoT Hub, the Azure IoT Hub extension is a very useful tool. An interesting alternative to this tool is the [Azure IoT Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases) which is more user-friendly thanks to its simple UI but does not have all the features.

And that's it for this week, happy learning!
