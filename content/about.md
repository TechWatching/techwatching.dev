Hi, my name is Alexandre Nédélec. I am a software developer living in Bordeaux.

I graduated from the Engineer School [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr) in Computer Sciences over 10 years ago. I am currently working for an IT consulting company specialized in Microsoft Technologies.
I am a .NET and Azure enthusiast, primarily coding in C# but I like to discover other languages and technologies too. I want to keep learning and always become a better developer.

My blog and its posts are a good way to remind me of things I have learned, solutions and workarounds to some coding issues I have encountered and helpful tools I have used. This blog is also a place to write about things I am interested in and if it can make some people learn something new or help them solve a problem, that's for the better.

This website is built using [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) and [NuxtUI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/). It was initially created using the [NuxtUI Pro SaaS template](https://github.com/nuxt-ui-pro/saas) but was also inspired by other websites (like [Nuxt website](https://nuxt.com/)). Previously, my blog was generated using [Statiq](https://www.statiq.dev/), but I have switched to Nuxt to benefit from the Nuxt ecosystem.
