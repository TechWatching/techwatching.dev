## History of this project

My original blog was built in .NET using [Statiq](https://www.statiq.dev/web) (and even [Wyam](https://github.com/Wyamio/Wyam) before that).
It worked well, and I could have kept using it. But in 2024, I decided to migrate the blog to Nuxt in 2024 to benefits from the Vue.js/Nuxt ecosystem and because I was more familiar with Vue.js for frontend development.
The code that used the Statiq Web static website generation toolkit in .NET can still be found on the [statiqdev branch](https://github.com/TechWatching/techwatching.dev/tree/statiqdev).
